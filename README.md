TindPlayer
==============================

Context
--------

TindPlayer is a toy app I made on my spare time earlier from december 2014 to february 2015.
I'm quite busy with new projects so I decided to open source the code of this app.
It used to be on the Play Store but due to a DMCA takedown notice it was removed
and though the counter-notice has been issued and accepted, I'm too lazy to restore the app.
So feel free to use directly the apk or tweak it.

There are few concurrency bugs that need to be addressed for specific corner cases but I didn't
had time to dig into them.

Have fun !

Features
--------

TindPlayer uses the Tinder platform to provide some advanced options that does not provide the official application:

- Matche all proposals available in seconds
- Change your location to anywhere in the world
- Keep a history of your last likes
- Multi-account management Facebook
- Remove the like before a potential match

On the main screen, the first button like everyone (loop) while the second will like those displayed. Holding down a photo displays the detail.
