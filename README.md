TindPlayer
==============================

Context
--------

TindPlayer is a toy app I made on my spare time earlier since december 2014.

Code is pretty dirty (it's mostly a proof of concept and doesn't reflect in any way what I do for
 a living - I don't even program on Android nor Java anymore at work.

I have a lot of other things going on so I may not fix/update things in a timely manner.
Feel free to use directly the apk or tweak it.

Have fun !

Features
--------

TindPlayer uses the Tinder platform to provide some advanced options that does not provide the official application:

- Matche all proposals available in seconds
- Change your location to anywhere in the world
- Keep a history of your last likes
- Multi-account management Facebook
- Remove the like before a potential match

On the main screen, the first button like everyone (loop) while the second will like those displayed. Holding down a photo displays the detail.
