To download it on your Android phone, go on https://github.com/Kayrnt/TindPlayer/releases from your phone.

Context
--------

TindPlayer is a toy app I made on my spare time earlier since december 2014.

Code is pretty dirty (it's mostly a proof of concept and doesn't reflect in any way what I do for
 a living - I don't even program on Android nor Java anymore at work.)

I have a lot of other things going on so I may not fix/update things in a timely manner.
Feel free to use directly the apk or tweak it.

The application is not available on Google Play Store because Tinder had it removed since it was too "powerful".
It's 100% free (no ads) and open source (APACHE 2).

Have fun!

Features
--------

TindPlayer uses the Tinder platform to provide some advanced options that does not provide the official application:

- Matche all proposals available in seconds
- Change your location to anywhere in the world
- Keep a history of your last likes
- Multi-account management Facebook
- Remove the like before a potential match

On the main screen, the first button like everyone (loop) while the second will like those displayed. Holding down a photo displays the detail.
